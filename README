DESCRIPTION

    PSGI is a specification to decouple web server environments from web
    application framework code. Test::WWW::Mechanize is a subclass of
    WWW::Mechanize that incorporates features for web application testing.
    The Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI module meshes the two to allow easy
    testing of PSGI applications.

    Testing web applications has always been a bit tricky, normally
    requiring starting a web server for your application and making real
    HTTP requests to it. This module allows you to test PSGI web
    applications but does not require a server or issue HTTP requests.
    Instead, it passes the HTTP request object directly to PSGI. Thus you
    do not need to use a real hostname: "http://localhost/" will do.
    However, this is optional. The following two lines of code do exactly
    the same thing:

      $mech->get_ok('/action');
      $mech->get_ok('http://localhost/action');

    This makes testing fast and easy. Test::WWW::Mechanize provides
    functions for common web testing scenarios. For example:

      $mech->get_ok( $page );
      $mech->title_is( "Invoice Status", "Make sure we're on the invoice page" );
      $mech->content_contains( "Andy Lester", "My name somewhere" );
      $mech->content_like( qr/(cpan|perl)\.org/, "Link to perl.org or CPAN" );

    An alternative to this module is Plack::Test.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

    Behaves like, and calls, WWW::Mechanize's new method. You should pass
    in your application:

      my $mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI->new(
          app => sub {
              my $env = shift;
              return [ 200, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ], ['Hello World'] ],;
          },
      );

METHODS: HTTP VERBS

 $mech->get_ok($url, [ \%LWP_options ,] $desc)

    A wrapper around WWW::Mechanize's get(), with similar options, except
    the second argument needs to be a hash reference, not a hash. Like
    well-behaved *_ok() functions, it returns true if the test passed, or
    false if not.

    A default description of "GET $url" is used if none if provided.

 $mech->head_ok($url, [ \%LWP_options ,] $desc)

    A wrapper around WWW::Mechanize's head(), with similar options, except
    the second argument needs to be a hash reference, not a hash. Like
    well-behaved *_ok() functions, it returns true if the test passed, or
    false if not.

    A default description of "HEAD $url" is used if none if provided.

 $mech->post_ok( $url, [ \%LWP_options ,] $desc )

    A wrapper around WWW::Mechanize's post(), with similar options, except
    the second argument needs to be a hash reference, not a hash. Like
    well-behaved *_ok() functions, it returns true if the test passed, or
    false if not.

    A default description of "POST to $url" is used if none if provided.

 $mech->put_ok( $url, [ \%LWP_options ,] $desc )

    A wrapper around WWW::Mechanize's put(), with similar options, except
    the second argument needs to be a hash reference, not a hash. Like
    well-behaved *_ok() functions, it returns true if the test passed, or
    false if not.

    A default description of "PUT to $url" is used if none if provided.

 $mech->submit_form_ok( \%parms [, $desc] )

    Makes a submit_form() call and executes tests on the results. The form
    must be found, and then submitted successfully. Otherwise, this test
    fails.

    %parms is a hashref containing the parms to pass to submit_form(). Note
    that the parms to submit_form() are a hash whereas the parms to this
    function are a hashref. You have to call this function like:

        $agent->submit_form_ok({
            form_number => 3,
            fields      => {
                username    => 'mungo',
                password    => 'lost-and-alone',
            }
        }, "looking for 3rd form" );

    As with other test functions, $desc is optional. If it is supplied then
    it will display when running the test harness in verbose mode.

    Returns true value if the specified link was found and followed
    successfully. The HTTP::Response object returned by submit_form() is
    not available.

 $mech->follow_link_ok( \%parms [, $desc] )

    Makes a follow_link() call and executes tests on the results. The link
    must be found, and then followed successfully. Otherwise, this test
    fails.

    %parms is a hashref containing the parms to pass to follow_link(). Note
    that the parms to follow_link() are a hash whereas the parms to this
    function are a hashref. You have to call this function like:

        $mech->follow_link_ok( {n=>3}, "looking for 3rd link" );

    As with other test functions, $desc is optional. If it is supplied then
    it will display when running the test harness in verbose mode.

    Returns a true value if the specified link was found and followed
    successfully. The HTTP::Response object returned by follow_link() is
    not available.

 click_ok( $button[, $desc] )

    Clicks the button named by $button. An optional $desc can be given for
    the test.

METHODS: CONTENT CHECKING

 $mech->html_lint_ok( [$desc] )

    Checks the validity of the HTML on the current page. If the page is not
    HTML, then it fails. The URI is automatically appended to the $desc.

    Note that HTML::Lint must be installed for this to work. Otherwise, it
    will blow up.

 $mech->title_is( $str [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the title of the page is the given string.

        $mech->title_is( "Invoice Summary" );

        $mech->title_like( qr/Invoices for (.+)/

 $mech->title_unlike( $regex [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the title of the page matches the given regex.

        $mech->title_unlike( qr/Invoices for (.+)/

 $mech->base_is( $str [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the base of the page is the given string.

        $mech->base_is( "http://example.com/" );

 $mech->base_like( $regex [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the base of the page matches the given regex.

        $mech->base_like( qr{http://example.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=(.+)});

 $mech->base_unlike( $regex [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the base of the page matches the given regex.

        $mech->base_unlike( qr{http://example.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=(.+)});

 $mech->content_is( $str [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the content of the page matches the given string

 $mech->content_contains( $str [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the content of the page contains $str.

 $mech->content_lacks( $str [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the content of the page lacks $str.

 $mech->content_like( $regex [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the content of the page matches $regex.

 $mech->content_unlike( $regex [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the content of the page does NOT match $regex.

 $mech->has_tag( $tag, $text [, $desc ] )

    Tells if the page has a $tag tag with the given content in its text.

    Follow all links on the current page and test for HTTP status 200

        $mech->page_links_ok('Check all links');

 $mech->page_links_content_like( $regex [, $desc ] )

    Follow all links on the current page and test their contents for
    $regex.

        $mech->page_links_content_like( qr/foo/,
          'Check all links contain "foo"' );

 $mech->links_ok( $links [, $desc ] )

    Follow specified links on the current page and test for HTTP status
    200. The links may be specified as a reference to an array containing
    WWW::Mechanize::Link objects, an array of URLs, or a scalar URL name.

        my @links = $mech->find_all_links( url_regex => qr/cnn\.com$/ );
        $mech->links_ok( \@links, 'Check all links for cnn.com' );
    
        my @links = qw( index.html search.html about.html );
        $mech->links_ok( \@links, 'Check main links' );
    
        $mech->links_ok( 'index.html', 'Check link to index' );

 $mech->link_status_is( $links, $status [, $desc ] )

    Follow specified links on the current page and test for HTTP status
    passed. The links may be specified as a reference to an array
    containing WWW::Mechanize::Link objects, an array of URLs, or a scalar
    URL name.

        my @links = $mech->followable_links();
        $mech->link_status_is( \@links, 403,
          'Check all links are restricted' );

 $mech->link_status_isnt( $links, $status [, $desc ] )

    Follow specified links on the current page and test for HTTP status
    passed. The links may be specified as a reference to an array
    containing WWW::Mechanize::Link objects, an array of URLs, or a scalar
    URL name.

        my @links = $mech->followable_links();
        $mech->link_status_isnt( \@links, 404,
          'Check all links are not 404' );

 $mech->link_content_like( $links, $regex [, $desc ] )

    Follow specified links on the current page and test the resulting
    content of each against $regex. The links may be specified as a
    reference to an array containing WWW::Mechanize::Link objects, an array
    of URLs, or a scalar URL name.

        my @links = $mech->followable_links();
        $mech->link_content_like( \@links, qr/Restricted/,
            'Check all links are restricted' );

 $mech->link_content_unlike( $links, $regex [, $desc ] )

        my @links = $mech->followable_links();
        $mech->link_content_unlike( \@links, qr/Restricted/,
          'No restricted links' );

 $mech->stuff_inputs( [\%options] )

    Finds all free-text input fields (text, textarea, and password) in the
    current form and fills them to their maximum length in hopes of finding
    application code that can't handle it. Fields with no maximum length
    and all textarea fields are set to 66000 bytes, which will often be
    enough to overflow the data's eventual recepticle.

    There is no return value.

    If there is no current form then nothing is done.

    The hashref $options can contain the following keys:

      * ignore

      hash value is arrayref of field names to not touch, e.g.:

          $mech->stuff_inputs( {
              ignore => [qw( specialfield1 specialfield2 )],
          } );

      * fill

      hash value is default string to use when stuffing fields. Copies of
      the string are repeated up to the max length of each field. E.g.:

          $mech->stuff_inputs( {
              fill => '@'  # stuff all fields with something easy to recognize
          } );

      * specs

      hash value is arrayref of hashrefs with which you can pass detailed
      instructions about how to stuff a given field. E.g.:

          $mech->stuff_inputs( {
              specs=>{
                  # Some fields are datatype-constrained.  It's most common to
                  # want the field stuffed with valid data.
                  widget_quantity => { fill=>'9' },
                  notes => { maxlength=>2000 },
              }
          } );

      The specs allowed are fill (use this fill for the field rather than
      the default) and maxlength (use this as the field's maxlength instead
      of any maxlength specified in the HTML).
